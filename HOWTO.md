# Verify extruder tension

- Loosen the tension
- Heat up the hotend so extruder motor is energized
- Open the latch
- Insert filament
- Close the latch and pull
- If it comes out, tighten one full turn
- Pull again and repeat if it slips
- Once it does not slip, add another full turn, maybe one and a half turns
